# source-TicTacToe
A version of TicTacToe/Noughts and Crosses that runs in the source engine's console

## Installation
Unzip the release (or download the source code), and place the 'tictactoe' folder into the cfg folder for whichever game you wish to use. That's it!

## Running
After installation, using the 'exec tictactoe/2-player' in the console of the given game will start the program. There will be some additional information printed in the console after doing this. 

## AI?
I started making a perfect AI, but ran into some issues, so I'm starting with the 2-player version first.

I don't know if I will ever go back to it but I will update the repo if I ever do.
